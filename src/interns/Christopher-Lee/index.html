                My name is Christopher Lee and I first desired to become a software engineer after taking a
                computer science class in high school. I ended up majoring in computer science and I fell in love with
                the wide applications of computer science. The type of software I am currently interested in developing
                is backend web development.
            </p>
            <p> During this internship I would love to apply some of the skills I have learned in my previous workplace and
                as well as school. In particular, I would love to apply my knowledge of databases and SQL as well as
                webservices such as the RESTful API in order to create software that would be beneficial to Lob.
